" Save undo history
"  By default, undo files (.file.txt.un~) are saved in the current directory.
"  This makes the file system very messy, so undofile is disabled by default.
"
"  If would like to enable undofile, I recommend you to change undodir:
"  1. Create the undo directory: `:! mkdir -p ~/.vim/undo/`
"  2. Uncomment the following line starting with 'set undodir' and save the file
"  3. Source the .vimrc: `:source ~/.vimrc`
"  4. Now undo history will persist between Vim sessions
"
"  NOTE: See `:help undofile` and `:help undodir` for more information
"    You may change the undodir to another directory you prefer
